Project Overview: Fashion MNIST Image Classification Web App

This project presents a deep learningâ€“powered image classification system built using the **Fashion MNIST dataset**. The model is trained to recognize 10 different types of clothing items and accessories, such as shirts, sneakers, and bags. The unique aspect of this project is that it integrates the trained model into a **Flask-based web application**, enabling users to upload and classify fashion images through a simple browser interface.

Objective

The primary goal is to classify grayscale images of clothing items into one of the 10 categories provided by the Fashion MNIST dataset. The application simulates a real-world machine learning deployment pipeline, demonstrating how to:

* Train and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN)
* Save and load a trained model using Keras


 Fashion MNIST Dataset Description

Fashion MNIST is a dataset of **28x28 grayscale images** of clothing items, released by Zalando Research. It is considered a more challenging and realistic alternative to the original MNIST (handwritten digits) dataset.

There are **10 classes** in the dataset:

1. T-shirt/top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
10. Ankle boot

Each image is labeled with one of these categories and is used to train the CNN model.

 Model Architecture and Training

The deep learning model used in this project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed for image classification tasks. The architecture typically consists of:

* Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
* MaxPooling layers for downsampling
* Dropout layers to reduce overfitting
* Dense layers for final classification

The model is compiled with the **categorical crossentropy loss**, **Adam optimizer**, and **accuracy metric**. After training, the model is saved in HDF5 format (`.h5`) for easy deployment.


Web Application Integration

The trained CNN model is integrated into a Flask web application that allows end-users to:

* Upload a fashion image (preferably 28x28 grayscale)
* Automatically preprocess and normalize the image
* Get an instant prediction with a clear textual label


 Application Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

* **app.py**: Main Flask backend script
* **model/**: Contains the trained Keras model (`fashion_model.h5`)
* **README.md**: Documentation for the project

 Usage Instructions

1. **Train the model** (optional): You can use the Fashion MNIST dataset and train a model using TensorFlow/Keras. Save it as `fashion_model.h5`.

2. **Prepare the project folder**: Place the saved model inside a `model/` directory and ensure `app.py`, `templates/`, and `static/` folders are properly set up.

3. **Install required packages**:
   Use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.


 Potential Enhancements

* **Visualization with Grad-CAM** to highlight regions used in prediction
* **Streamlit or Dash UI** for a more dynamic frontend
* **Model versioning and monitoring**
* **Deployment on cloud platforms** like Render, Hugging Face Spaces, or Heroku

Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning deployment, bridging the gap between model development and user-facing applications. It gives hands-on experience with:

* Deep learning and computer vision
* Data preprocessing for image classification
* Saving/loading models in TensorFlow/Keras
